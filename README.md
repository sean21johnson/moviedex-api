MOVIEDEX API

Server-side project that returns an array of movies from a database based on specific query parameters in the URL.

In this application, a user can:

	-View all of the movies in the database.
	-Search for movies based on genre, country, and/or average vote score.
	-Use query parameters "searchGenre", "searchCountry", and "searchAverageScore" to specify exactly the type of movie they are looking for.
	-Only get a valid list of movies if they have valid Authorization with a Bearer API token value.

I utilized the below in creating this back-end application:

	-Express
	-Response & Request Messaging
	-CORS support
